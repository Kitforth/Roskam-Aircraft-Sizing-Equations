#You will need:
    # Weight_takeoff (guess)
    # Weight_fuel
    # Weight_payload

# then determine
# Weight_empty from another section.


#For RC and battery driven aircraft the flight weight is unchanging, and there is essentially 0 trapped fuel weight, simplifying analysis significantly.
Weight_fuel = Weight_battery
Weight_trapped_fuel = 0
Weight_crew = 0
#Hence Weight_operating_empty = Weight_empty for RC craft.

Weight_takeoff = Weight_operating_empty + Weight_fuel + Weight_payload

Weight_operating_empty = Weight_empty + Weight_trapped_fuel + Weight_crew

Weight_empty = Weight_manufacturing_empty + Weight_fixed_equipment

#Weight_fuel should be easy to estimate from basic flight profiles
#log Weight_takeoff and log Weight_empty maintain a linear relationship for the twelve types of aircraft.

#Step 1. Determine the mission payload weight Weight_payload
#Step 2. Guess Weight_takeoff
#Step 3. Determine Weight_fuel
#Step 4. Calculate tentative value for Weight_operating_empty from:
#       Weight_operating_empty(tentative) = Weight_takeoff(guess) - Weight_fuel - Weight_payload
#Step 5. Calculate a tentative value for Weight_empty from:
#       Weight_empty(tentative) = Weight_operating_empty(tentative) - Weight_trapped_fuel -Weight_crew
#       Weight of trapped fuel can be as high as 0.5% of takeoff weight, but is often neglected at this early stage.
#Step 6.    Find allowable value of Weight_empty from section 2.5
#Step 7.    Compare the tentative and referenced values of Weight_empty, and iterate Weight takeoff until empty weight values align. (typically within 0.5%

#Weight in pounds
# if long_flight:
#     Weight_crew = 175 + 40
# else:
#     Weight_crew = 175 + 30

if long_flight:
    Weight_crewmember = 79.3787 + 18.1437
else:
    Weight_crewmember = 79.3787 + 13.6078

if military:
    Weight_crewmember = 90.7185

Weight_crew = number_of_crew * Weight_crewmember



Weight_payload = Weight_passengers + Weight_baggage + Weight_cargo + Weight_mission_equipment + Weight_ammunition #For military aircraft

Weight_passengers = Weight_passenger * num_passengers #Weight estimations for passengers are the same as crewmembers for commercial flights.

#2.3 Guessing a likely value of take-off weight, Weight_takeoff
#Initial guess of the value of takeoff weight, obtained by comparing the mission specificaiton of the aircraft with the
# mission capabilities of similar airplanes listed in reference 9. Or make a Guess.


#2.4 Determination of mission fuel weight. Weight_fuel
Weight_fuel= weight_fuel_used + weight_fuel_reesrve

#Weight reserve is specified as:
    #1) a fraction of weight_fuel_used
    #2) as a requirement for additional range to reach an alternate airport
    #3) as a requirement for additional loiter time

#To determine Weight_fuel_used, the fuel weight actually used during the mission, (the fuel fraction method) is used.
# In this method the airplane mission is broken down into a number of numbered mission phases. The fuel used each phase
# is found from a simple calculation or estimated from experience. Each phase has a beginning and an end weight
# associated with it.

#TODO I'm skipping this part(fuel weight fraction) as we're not designing to fuel and it's tricky to code in. Someone else can code this in
# at their leisure if they wish to design aircraft with it, and I'll include it in the repository.

#todo Although, electric propulsion we should still design for mission stages, just with flight performance
# requirements, and energy requirements to size the battery. we may need to devise a similar but distinct methodology.
